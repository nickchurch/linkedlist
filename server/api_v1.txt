    (information stored in db on server, can be accessed using our RESTful API):

    user:
        -email address
            (unique, basically your username, what people will invite you with)
        -auth token
            (hashed password and username)
        -name (nickname)
            (first and last separate fields or not?)
        -profile picture
            (related field to images table, this is a stretch goal, along with all other picture related fields in other objects)

    list:
        -user_id for owner of list
        -list name (e.g. "my family's shared shopping list")
        -potentially a picture like a "cover photo" for a list, like a picture of your house if it's a shopping list for your house

    list_item:
        -list_id for the associated list object
        -item text
            (a string which could be "extra sharp cheddar",
            or "please take out the trash before 6:00pm")
        -a boolean status that represents done/purchased/completed
        -an optional image of the item to be purchased
            e.g.: if you want a specific kind of extra sharp cheddar, and you would like to give your friend/family member
            a visual cue for the exact brand or kind you want.

	list associations

    -Beyond having a table for images which is rather simple, all we need to have are some relations defined in the db:
        -a relation of user_id's to lists -- all user_id's associated with a list (including owner)
        -a relation of user_id's to user_id's for who is "friends" with who
        -a relation of list_item_id's to lists for which items belong to which list

    * except for logging in, all requests will need to be accompanied by an auth token *
    * NOTE: these API paths can be assumed to handle all necessary permissions checking and
    * data validation which the server will handle.

# General planning and future goals #
#####################################

-we could eventually do things like parse the list_item's strings for times and things like that, and use
    a default reminder delta after which we could send the user a notification.
    the reminder window could be manually altered by any user in the linked list though.

        -ex: we have a list item with the string "please do X {before|after|by|at|...} 13:37"
        for all users who are a member of this list and have notifications turned on we give them a
        relative push notification. Say our default time delta is 30 minutes, and no one has touched notifications
        for this list_item (enabled by default).
            for example, if the string says "please do X before 13:37", we take the default time delta and push a
            notification at $list_item_deadline - $delta, so 13:07, and if the modifier was "after" we could push
            a notification at 14:07, and so on..

-have the owner of the list be able to specify list permissions, there will be a default set of permissions each list starts with, but
the owner can specify individual permissions as well.

    users can have some combination of the following permissions:
        item read access: (implied to always be true, otherwise what's the sense in being added to a list if you can't read it)

        item create access: do you have permissions to add items to a list or not

        item update access: could range from being able to update all fields of a list item to just being able to mark an item as completed

        item destroy access: "admin" level permissions, originally only the owner has access but can modify another list member's permissions
